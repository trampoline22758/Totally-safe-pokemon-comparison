## What‚Äôs This?

A simple Python script that fetches Pok√©mon data from a public CSV, lets you filter Pok√©mon by type, and then plot two stats against each other for a cool visual comparison.

- Displays a scatter plot with matplotlib  
- Fun ASCII art easter egg when you type **"I"** (must be uppercase!)
